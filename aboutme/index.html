        <p>
            I am seeking to earn a degree in Applied technology. I am taking the option of Web and Computer programming.<br>
            I have earned a degree in Bsc. Petroleum Engineering and it was during my studies that I found my greatest <br>
            interest in programming. I love the career path that I can work remotely and have most times possible with my<br>
            future family. I love nature, music and art. I am single. I have been a member of the church from birth.<br>
            My favorite scripture is Ether 12:27, "The Lord giveth weakness unto men that we may be humble. If we are<br> 
            sufficiently humble, He will make our weakness become our strength."

            One of the things I love about BYU-Idaho is how supportive the instructors are. I love how uplifting the<br> 
            religious courses and content helps me stay committed and motivated to finish up and excel in my chosen<br>
            path of career. I look forward to having a great time and making some friends.
