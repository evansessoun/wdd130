      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to show potential employers
         and freelancing clients my skillsets and other projects I have worked on.
         The site will provide my contact information to potential clients and 
         employers. It will also link my other social pages such as linkedIn and 
         facebook page to provide additional information to employers, clients 
         and other developers when needed.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p> The audience are future employers, freelancing clients and other 
        web developers who may want to collaborate with me to work on projects.
        The audience will mostly access the site over a laptop computer and 
        occassionaly over mobile devices. Because most of the audience will be 
        young adult and middle-aged group in professional setups, the content and colors
        will be moderately vibrant and more professional.
