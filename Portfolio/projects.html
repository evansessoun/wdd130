                        <h2>Developing of Virtual Rig</h2>
                        I have built a virtual rig using mathematical models developed in python and 
                        LabView in the 2020/2021 International Drillbotics competition organized by 
                        DSATS of Society of Petroleum engineers. This made my team and I the first african participant
                        to compete in the competition and made it to the top 3 competitors.
                        I have also developed small desktop applications using python and QT designer
                        for building program interface. I have converted most of these applications to standalone
                        windows applications and few of for mobile devices.
